How to operate the game:
1. Input on the options menu (**1** to start, **2** to exit)
2a. If input = **1**, then the game will ask to input player name and a letter to be used as pawn. This game is designed for two players.
2b. If input = **2**, then the game will ask for confirmation to exit the game.
3. The game board will be displayed with both the players' pawns at the initial position (square #1) with different colors.
4. The game will ask each player to roll the dice (input **y** to roll the dice, or **n** to skip rolling).
5a. If input = **y**, the dice will be rolled. Movement of the pawn will follow the roll result. If the pawn hit a snake/ladder after moving, a motivational message will be displayed.
5b. If input = **n**, the choice will be respected nonetheless. The game continues and asks the opposing player to roll the dice.
6. The game is finished once a player reaches the end of the journey (square #100).
7. P R O F I C I A T! will be displayed once a player finished the game. For the unlucky player, keep your heads up!
8. Game over.
